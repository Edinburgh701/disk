  <h1>Leadership goals and experience</h1>

  <p> Below are relevant work/leadership experiences, and goals I have in that regard.</p>

  <h2>Meditations on my Leadership Goals</h2>
  <p>
    I would like to start up a club here at UT Austin, I have a interest/hobby set I would be more than enthused to share with other people, perhaps revive the old 
    Austin lock-picking club, or bring back UT Billiards and go back to playing competitively. I sometimes also think I could start up my own original project with
    a big fancy title like "Texas Classical Physics", and we'd call it TCP for short, with the slogan "None of the quantum nonsence". I've also noticed UT lacks a guitar
    club, and while difficult to manage, is really easy to get off the ground.

  <h3>Previous & Current leadership experince</h3>
  <p>
    Prevously, the more "formal" club expereince's I've had were being the president of my Highschools Amereican Red Cross Club, where we would organise blood drives, field
    trips to Red Cross meetings across Texas, and run school food drives, and othe community service events. Alot more recenlty, I have compeated in a Billiards tournyments 
    accross Texas universites with a team. Today, I am a lead instructor at the Mathnasium institution where I work as an educator for students k-12.
